PHASE 1:
Login (if only use firestore --> just fake login (use local storage))
Register
Create posts
Main (load all posts, [order by createdAt DESC])
UserInfo (show & update user's info)

PHASE 2:
Add an input to search users and `Follow` button (after user's name). Click it to follow that user.
On main page, just load posts of logged in user and followed users.
We can comment on each post. Load all comments of posts (display user's name and comment time, sort by commentId.createdAt desc)
